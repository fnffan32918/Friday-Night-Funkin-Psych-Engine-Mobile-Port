# Friday-Night-Funkin-Psych-Engine-Mobile-Port
Using the popular port as reference ive been able to scrap everything together, and shorten the overall filesize down to just 6MB ðŸ˜² (this took forever)

[its 6mb because i built the app using its "HTML5 SOURCE" the only downside is an constant internet connection is required to play]

# Read Before Installing
Android : AAB/APK file's can be installed via ADB/LOCAL. 

IOS : Requires an "Apple Devoloper Account" to install Psych Engine 
( sorry:< )

# Dont do that!
do not edit the controls unless you are using a physical keyboard!
(doing so without one will softlock the game!)

mobile control changing
is broken at the moment.

# Credits
- thanks for the inspiration 
"Mcgabe19" this project wouldnt have been completed without your discoveries for mobile inputs.
- The Devs Of FNF (you have brought a beautiful community to the earth that deserves to stay

# Requirements
WIFI or DATA is required
to make this build as small as possible i built the engine from its "html5 source" which means it can auto-update to the latest version without going past 6MB :3
