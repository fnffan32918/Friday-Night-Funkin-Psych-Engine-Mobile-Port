# Friday-Night-Funkin-Psych-Engine-Mobile-Port
Using the popular port as reference ive been able to scrap everything together, and shorten the overall filesize down to just 6MB ðŸ˜² (this took forever)

# Read Before Installing
Android : AAB/APK file's can be installed via ADB/LOCAL. 

IOS : Requires an "Apple Devoloper Account" to install Psych Engine 
( sorry:< )

# Dont do that!
do not edit the controls unless you are using a physical keyboard!
(doing so without one will softlock the game!)

mobile control changing
is broken at the moment.
